# Computational ML Lab

Welcome to the documentation for the Computational ML Lab - a comprehensive learning path for ML engineering with a physics and mathematics flavor.

## 🎯 What You'll Build

This repository guides you through:

- **Numerical Methods** - Linear algebra, optimization, stability analysis
- **Statistical Inference** - Estimation, hypothesis testing, uncertainty quantification
- **Machine Learning** - From linear models to deep learning
- **Scientific Computing** - Physics-informed ML, simulation, state estimation
- **MLOps** - Production deployment, monitoring, APIs

- [Module Structure](getting-started/module-structure.md) - How modules are organized
- [Contributing](contributing.md) - Development guidelines

## 📚 Learning Philosophy

1. **Theory → Implementation → Evaluation** - Every concept includes mathematical foundations, from-scratch implementation, and rigorous testing
2. **Physics/Math First** - Emphasis on numerical stability, conditioning, error analysis
3. **Engineering Rigor** - Tests, documentation, reproducibility, CI/CD
4. **Portfolio Quality** - Production-ready code suitable for showcasing
